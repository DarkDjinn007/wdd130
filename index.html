        <p>Lagos is a major city located in the southwestern part of Nigeria, along the coast of 
            the Atlantic Ocean. It lies approximately between latitude 6.5244° N and longitude 
            3.3792° E. As the most populous city in Nigeria and one of the fastest-growing cities
            in the world, Lagos serves as the country’s economic and cultural powerhouse. Originally 
            a small Yoruba fishing village, it has grown into a sprawling urban hub that includes the 
            mainland and a series of islands, such as Victoria Island and Lagos Island. The city is 
            known for its bustling markets, lively music scene, heavy traffic, and dynamic mix of modern
            skyscrapers and traditional neighborhoods.</p>
